    <h1>Tofu Coconut Curry</h1>
    <img src="../images/curry.jpg" alt="curry" width="450" height="450" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The creamy, golden coconut milk and tomato-based sauce is deliciously
      spiced with curry powder, turmeric, cumin (and of course salt and pepper)
      along with fresh pungent garlic and ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's mild and not very spicy (unless your curry powder blend is spicy),
      which is great to serve the whole family!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 yellow (or white) onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1-inch fresh ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp turmeric powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp cumin powder</li>
      <li>400 ml (14 fl. oz.) canned coconut milk</li>
      <li>½ cup crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>454 g extra firm plain tofu, chopped into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
      <li>1 lime, zest and juice</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Serve with cooked rice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large sauté pan or skillet (I use a 12-inch skillet) at medium-high
        heat, add the vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, salt, and pepper. Sauté
        until the onions begin to brown, about 4-5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the garlic, ginger, curry powder, turmeric, and cumin and stir
        for another minute or two, until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and stir in the coconut milk, crushed tomatoes,
        and tomato paste until well-incorporated. Add the tofu and gently stir
        to coat with the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the curry to a boil before reducing the heat to a simmer. Cook
        uncovered for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the spinach, lime zest, and lime juice, until the spinach wilts.
        Taste for additional salt and pepper. Top with fresh cilantro and serve
        over rice. Enjoy!
